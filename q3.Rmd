```{r, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

##### (a) Write a function factory `moment` which returns a function to compute the $k$ raw moment of a input ($k$ positive integer).

Hint: a $k$ raw moment of a vector `x` could be computed by `mean(x^k)`


```{r}
# YOUR definition of moment here
```


```{r}
x <- rnorm(10)

m1 <- moment(1)
m1(x)  # it should equal mean(x)

m2 <- moment(2)
m2(x)  # it should equal mean(x^2)
```



##### (b) Consider the `mpg` dataset and compute the first to fifth moments for each numerical column. Create a data frame where the columns are the variables and the rows are the moments. Print the data frame for visualization.


Hint: There are several solutions, the easiest one may be `map_dfr` or `map_dfc`. Another alternative is
`cross`/`map`/`reduce`.

1. **Important** (Skip if you have done so in assignment 1) Tell us your github account at https://signin-apd27wnqlq-uw.a.run.app/sta141c/. This will allow us to fetch your assignments later. Failing to do so will result in a zero grade of the assignments.
1. Accept the assignment via the link:
1. A repo containing your username `sta141c-assignment-n-USERNAME` will be created.<br>
    The assignment will be created at https://github.com/ucdavis-sta141c-2021-winter
1. Create a new RStudio project with the repo containing your username  (do not clone the template repo `sta141c-assignment-n`)

1. **Important** Knit the R Markdown files as html documents. Submission without the html files will score 0 points.
1. Commit the changes, including the html file
1. Push the changes to the `main` (or `master`) branch of the repo.
